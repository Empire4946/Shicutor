A GUI executor that sucks ass.

# QnA
Shicutor v1.1? why?:

better than shicutor, better than sentinel, sentinel = shit. skidded still btw, still complete shit.

---------------

Is Synapse Better than Shicutor?:

Actually, if you use synapse and you executed shicutor then it can execute synapse scripts since as I said before, "that is the same level of your original executor."

Should I use this as my main exploit:

You can now, since it is coregui, but if theres "anti-coregui" then you can't really use it lol

# Use now. (bad exploit XDDD)
